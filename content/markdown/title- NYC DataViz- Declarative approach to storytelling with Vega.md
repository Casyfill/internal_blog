summary: Extended deck of slides for the presentation on Vega and how we use it at StreetEasy (NYC DataVis Meetup)


Below is the extended deck of slides for the presentation I gave on NYC DataVIs Meetup; Here, I made an attempt to articulate reasons StreetEasy moved from tableau to [Vega][1] stack as our production visualization platform. I further explain the mere idea of declarative approach and the opportunities it gives. The rest of the slides cover Vega taxonomy, as well as different examples/pieces of large Vega family and an abstract scheme of StreetEasy Vega app.
